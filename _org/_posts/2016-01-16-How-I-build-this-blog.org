* Summary

  In ths blog I will show how I build this blog step by step, also the problems I encountered during this process. Hope it will be helpfull to those who want to do the same thing.

  I heard about github blog page and jekyll suport, as I already use org-mod with emacs, I chose this solution. Hope I can have a good experience in writing.

** System and Tools
      I use github.com as my blog host.
      + Operating System : ubuntu 15.04
      + Tools : emacs, org-mod, jekyll(depends on ruby), github .
      + Reference : [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html][org-jekyll-tutorials]], and template from [[https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-mark-reid][Mark-Reid]].
** Step by Step
   1. Setup github reponsity
   2. Install jekyll and configuration.
   3. Setup org publish configuration.
   4. Chose template. and adjust the theme.
   5. Write and enjoy.

** Work Flow
   1. I only mantain _posts folder, and .org post files. Here is my dictionary tree. And this folder have all my post, as cjq.io folder structure can be automate generated by rake command,  and we can change the theme within one rake command too. So I mantain two folder, _org, and cjq.io.  Everything about my writing is in cjq.io folder. I make a symbol link. Jekyll will ignore folders start with underscore(except certain name, such as _posts), so the _org folder is safe here, will not be posted twice. To generate cjq.io strcture, use this command.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      jekyll new cjq.io
      tree ~/dld/test-blog
      rake theme:install git="git://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-mark-reid.git"
      #+END_SRC


      #+BEGIN_SRC  sh
      tree ~/pro/n-txt/blog/cjq.io/_org
      #+END_SRC

      #+BEGIN_SRC
      | /cjq.io/_org
      | ├──   _drafts
      | │          └──    drafts.org
      | ├──   init-org-jekyll.el
      | └──   _posts
      |                ├──  | 2014-12-15-About.org
      |                └── | 2016-01-16-how.org
      #+END_SRC
      Here, I have a folder _drafts, which will not be ignored by jekyll, and I can put my drafts here. When I get it done, I can move it to _org/_posts folder, and publish it.
      Another file is init-org-jekyll.el, which control the options of org-publish. It is the same to put the contents in my .emacs file, but here I just put it together with my blog, and put a refer in my .emacs file, like this:
      #+BEGIN_SRC -emacs-lisp
      (load-file "~/pro/n-txt/blog/cjq.io/_org/init-org-jekyll.el")
      #+END_SRC

      this file can be find in my github [[https://github.com/chenjinqian/chenjinqian.github.io][repo]].

   3. use command org-publish in emacs, and chose post method cjq.io
   4. start jekyll at the blog root folder, with command
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      jekyll server --watch
      #+END_SRC
      Now it should be some thing like this:
      Here is the ref on the official site, but not work, as far as for now.
      #+BEGIN_SRC
      [jekyll server --watch]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/pic-jw.png)
      ![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/pic-banner.jpg)
      #+END_SRC
      Here is another try
      #+BEGIN_HTML
      <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/pic-jw.png" alt="The jekyll building."/>
      #+END_HTML
      And here is a [[http://codingtips.kanishkkunal.in/image-caption-jekyll/][link]] about using include and images. Will check latter.
