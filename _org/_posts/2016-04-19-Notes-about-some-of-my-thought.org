write quicky, to fluent your thought.

About free. I always remenber how I told her about the freedom to write. And maybe its not because of her, but because I have a chance to fully organise and officially express my opinon, which is her to thanks. Once I thought she was the only person I want frankly talk to, but now I am here because she do not want to speak to me any more recently.

Now, serious things. People talked about planed birth rath policy of china, some argument make me really mad. We are talking about the birth right of one individule person, but all they care is the virtual benifit( which I don't agree in long term) of volite that right. They act as if they are talking about picking up an apple under the tree, and argue that we should eat it.
First of all, tree does not fight for its own right, people do. Besides, that apple is not as sweet as they thought, even poison.

There is no meaning to talk about concept of fair or benifit, if there is no people at all. Fair is about a solution all roles in the game can or should accept. Its not about equal,  math is too simplified for the real world.
It's like the earth itself. No one make it a sephere, but it will collapse if not, by the gravity force of every atom. Still it is not perfect sephere,  but mountain will collapse if it is too high.
people fight for their own right, thus give force to fairness, which in it's virtual perfect situation is rather simple. If socity is bounded to stop that, then maybe one day, that force turn into voilence.

We have our decision for ourself to make, even that right and freedom is tiny, but it is completely belong to us, even god can not take our right and our force to guard it.  The best world is that we reach banlance and terms based on our force, without turn to volence which lead to death for all. Even I may surender to reach a term, but no one can ignore the absolute power of a man to rule himeself and fight for himself.

When I was told by some one, who claimed to do the good for all, that I should never had a birth. I say, I will fight for my life, will you fight against it on bid of your own? You will never fool me about that!
