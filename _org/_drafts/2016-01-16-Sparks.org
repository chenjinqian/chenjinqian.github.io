1 Sparks of my own brain.
2 self-see concerns
2.1 the failture comes over and over again

Here is what happend last three days. 12/01/2014, I lose my control to fake pleasure, and get really tired. I get headace the day after, and I amolst fall asleep when I was on the train back after the end of work, not notice that I get the wrong train. When I finally realise that, I make a mistake again getting into the next train right before the door close which turns out to be wrong again. This night, I sleep really early, no playing cellphone which is right beside me. I was full of energy the next day, 12/03/2014, yestoday. I went the old way before I notice, and sleep really late. I thought I have proved my perseverance, so I lost my will to do it. What a irony, people always think they can tell themself what is right and what is wrong, what they should do, make up a plan, and use their plan to get things done. How much I can read if I read 20 pages per day, only if I can learn France, so on and on. â€¦ I got up late and miss the train because I was reading, when I notice it, I went to the left door, end up wondering why the door is not open yet. What an idiolt. When I was siting in a chair, after I finally get down the train, I was thinking, why failture happens over and over again? People need energy to do thing right,
